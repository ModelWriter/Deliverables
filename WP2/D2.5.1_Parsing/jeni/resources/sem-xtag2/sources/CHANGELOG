*** CHANGELOG
As of 16th october 2013

- renamed some mg files to have a more homogeneous convention: 
	adj-adv.mg -> AdjectivesAdverbs.mg, 
	aux.mg -> Auxiliaries.mg
	lex.mg -> Lexicalization.mg
	neg.mg -> Negation.g

- removed dep, removed type DEP from header, commented Reln0A1s1, n0A1s1, Reln0N1s1, n0N1s1 which were using dep

- removed top=[mode=@{inf,ind,ger}] from TreeFragments.RelativeCovertExtractedWH

- added Lexicalization.alphaPronoun, alphaInterrogativePronoun, alphaRelativePronoun

- specified that alphaRelativePronoun should have an empty semantics (using sem=no in trace)

- added mark=nadj on red NP of RelativeOvertSubject, since it was adjoining determiners inside the relative clause "man who the sleep"

- added mark=nadj on red NP of RelativeCovertSubject

- removed mutex ImperativeSubject + active, it was blocking n0V + ImperativeSubject and I'm not sure why it was there

- added wh=- to alphaNXN top fs (to block the substitution of non wh-np into wh=+ slots)

- add (name=NP_S) to alphaPXPnx, added also (sem=no)

- added Auxiliaries.betaVvxTo to handle the "to" auxiliary (sem=no) with mode=inf

- added mark=nadj on red NP of RelativeCovertPPTop, since it was adjoining determiners on a std node (leaf np)

- added mark=nadj on root node of betaVs because given the empty semantics it was doing "do do do do john sleep" for instance.

- changed mode=imp by mode=ind in Auxiliaries.AX-afr-nocompMode-perfect-progressive-agr-tense-neg (not sure about why mode=imp)

- added Auxiliaries.betaVvxBe to handle the "be" auxiliary (sem=no) in passive structures, I had to do that because it is considered as a pattern

- modified Diathesis.dian0Vn1passive to consider the absent by-phrase

- added inv=- to foot of Auxiliaries.AX-afr-nocompMode-perfect-progressive-agr-tense-neg, if we want it to split the inv, it also needs to be there

- added new features pack for auxiliaries for betaVvx since the features were not reflecting XTAG features (see http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~xtag./tech-report/node176.html )

* mark=nadj on extracted trace (producing an empty np node):

- TreeFragments.RelativeOvertObject NP_obj node
- TreeFragments.RelativeOvertPPTop
- TreeFragments.RelativeCovertPPObject-VPE
- TreeFragments.RelativeOvertPPObject-VPE
