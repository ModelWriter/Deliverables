This directory contains the semxtag2 grammar with few classes manually annotated with semantics. Since we realized it was too much work to do it on *all* the classes we tried
an approach that annotates whole families thanks to their classes. The original XMG sources with the few bits of semantics have been kept in this directory to remember 
how to setup semantics manually, so this is mostly for documentation purposes.
