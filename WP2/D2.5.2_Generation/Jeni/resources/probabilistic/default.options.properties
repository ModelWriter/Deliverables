# DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE, IT IS USED FOR DEFAULT OPTIONS
# INSTEAD, USE options.properties FILE WHICH IS CREATED BY COPYING THIS FILE

### General purpose options
# These options are general.

# Set the debug level, 0 to disable, 1 activated, 2 detailed (integer)
DEBUG=0

# Set the timeout in milliseconds, 0 to disable (integer)
TIMEOUT=0

# If true, the feature constants are considered case dependent
# if false, the case does not matter in unification/subsumption
CASE_DEPENDENT=false

# Selects the policy when there are lexems that are not found
# IGNORE: ignores completely the missing lexem (the morph realization has then a different length than the syntactic one)
# OUTPUT_LEMMA: outputs a fake lexem whose surface form is the lemma, it actually hides the potential error
# OUTPUT_MISSING: outputs a fake lexem "<missing:lemma>" that explicitely warns about the missing lexem
# OUTPUT_MISSING_DETAILED: outputs a fake detailed lexem "<missing:lemma+fs>" that explicitely warns about the missing lemma
MISSING_LEXEM_POLICY=OUTPUT_MISSING

# Defines the default order for the morphological entries
# if true, each morph entry is assumed to be "lexem, lemma, fs"
# if false, each morph entry is assumed to be "lemma, lexem, fs"
MORPH_LEXEM_FIRST=false


### Optimizations
# These options are meant to control optimizations.

# If true uses polarity filtering (not supported yet)
USE_FILTERING=false

# The categories to use when doing filtering (a list of categories separated by comma)
FILTERING_CATEGORIES=s

# If true, checks for early failure based on the idx.
EARLY_SEMANTIC_FAILURE=true

# If true, models the semantics as a coverage-based semantics
# which speeds up the semantic overlap and equality tests 
USE_BIT_SEMANTICS=false

# If true renames the variables from the grammar such
# that no variable appears twice. This speeds up a little
RENAME_VARIABLES=false



### Format support
# These options control the new format/old format support, especially
# for the representation of lemmas.

# If true makes sure that the nodes of the trees have names
# following GenI convention
ASSIGN_NODE_IDS=true

# If true, rewrites the lex nodes in the grammar as lemma (new format support)
REWRITE_LEX_NODES=true

# If true, rewrites the lex features in the lexicon as lemma.
REWRITE_LEX_AS_LEMMA=true

# If true, rewrites the lemanchor values as lemma 
REWRITE_LEMANCHOR=true



### Internal settings
# Some of these settings could be also hardcoded.
# They have been set here such that you could change them if you observe something wrong.

# If true, allows that a lexicon entry does not specify the lemma, the lemma has
# thus to be informed within the semantics. Setting this option to false makes the
# lexicon stricter.
ALLOW_EMPTY_LEMMAS=true

# If true, accepts duplicates entries in the chart
ALLOW_DUPLICATES=false

# If true, ignores completely the labels when testing semantics subumption
IGNORE_LABELS=false

# If false, a failing anchoring equation causes the tree to
# be not selected ; if true, the tree is still selected despite
# the anchoring failure
ALLOW_MISSING_COANCHORS=false
