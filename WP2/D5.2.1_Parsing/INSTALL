How to run PGen (The Parser module)

Enter the following command in the terminal

1) cd pgen

2) ./run_parser.sh CONFIG_NAME
where CONFIG_NAME is one of the configuration specified in the configuration.xml file

Note: For now, 2 different parsing configurations have been defined for airbus dataset -- one for executing on simple sentences and the other on complex sentences. Accordingly, the following commands can be executed :

A) ./run_parser.sh parse_airbus_excellex_colbc_sentence
	The output is written to the folder resources/airbus/output/airbus_parse_output/excellex_colbc_sentences/

B) ./run_parser.sh parse_airbus_excellex_true_sentence
	The output is written to the folder resources/airbus/output/airbus_parse_output/excellex_true_sentences/
