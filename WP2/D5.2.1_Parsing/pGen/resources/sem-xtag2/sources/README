** ORIGINAL TIMESTAMP

Source: xtag sans semantique, compilable MetaTAG et xmg2. Syntaxe: Katya + Claire 
Coverage: NLG SR Task challenge 2012 cf. Narayan and Gardent COLING 2012

Creation: 26/09/2013


** CONTAINS
(needs refactoring)

The XMG sources (*.mg), with two entry points:
- valuation.mg which contains the full grammar
- minival.mg a subset of valuation.mg which only covers few trees

A script build.sh which compiles the minival grammar by default using MetaTAG (requires that MetaTAG is correctly installed and
on the path), and copies it into parent folder under as grammar.xml.

Original Katya lexicon file (lexicon.lex) - we could use it later.

Documentation about the grammar: msc-sb2008.pdf (Katya Alahverdzhieva/Saint Amand now, MSc 2008).
