This directory contains a very small grammar, lexicon and testsuite for testing probabilistic Jeni.

There is one entry in the testsuite. 

The lexicon contains 2 entries for the property mentioned in that testsuite, one with probability 0.75 the other with probability 0.25. 

The probability of the nouns is 1. 

Hence when testing the output should be :

Rank 1 (highest probability):  Yuri_Usachov was born in Russia
Test resources for testing probabilistic PJeni

Rank 2 (second highest probability):  Yuri_Usachov started at Russia

where the probability of a derived tree is simply the product of the probability of each lexicalised tree ie

1 * 1 * 0.75 for the first solution
1 * 1 * 0.25 for the second solution
