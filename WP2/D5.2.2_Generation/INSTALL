Note : 

1) To execute this jar, the file configuration.xml and log4j.xml also need to be at the same folder as the jar itself. So, if copying this jar to other folder, do copy the configuration.xml and the log4j.xml files too.

2) Several examples of grammar, lexicon and test suites fit for different use cases are available inside the folder Jeni/resources
