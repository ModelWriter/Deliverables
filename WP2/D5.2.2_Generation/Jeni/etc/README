* Some useful files to work with Eclipse

Working under Eclipse 3.7:

- coding-style.xml : imports this file in Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter > Import...

- cbg.editor_1.2.6.jar : a plugin that provides some highlighting support for the Jeni test suite format, based on the ColorEditor plugin.
	(we should find a way to change the name).
	- copy the plugin to the directory "plugins" of your Eclipse installation
	- restart Eclipse
	- you can now either do: Right click on a .jeni file > Open With > Other > Internal Editors > Syntax Coloring Editor
	- or you can set the association of .jeni files to this editor: Preferences > General > Editors > File Associations > Add... > enter *.jeni and 
	  add the editor Internal Editors > Syntax Coloring Editor
	- the color scheme is the default one, you'd better change it to your preferences: Preferences > Coloring Editor > Colors 

- jeni-syntax-highlighting : contains the sources of the ColorEditor plugin, including a jeni basic syntax file.
	- the jeni syntax file is located in jeni-syntax-highlighting/modes/jeni.xml
	- the format is described on http://www.jedit.org/users-guide/writing-modes-part.html (the Jedit Edit Mode format),
	  get ColorEditor full sources to have examples of the format. 
	- to compile, first cd etc/jeni-syntax-highlighting
	- ./build.sh (builds the plugin to etc/cbg.editor_1.2.6.jar),
